Consisting of over 100 services and with end-to-end tools to make design, development and deployment simple, Azure makes teaching many modules simpler, with less requirements on lab machine setup, configuration, and security. In this fundamentals presentation, we will cover setting up your Azure account, using the Azure portal, creating sample services (VM, web app, database, Azure functions), starting and stopping services, and connecting to these services with code. No previous cloud experience is required, though familiarity with coding and databases would be advantageous.
